The SI unit of magnetic flux is the weber (Wb) (in derived units: volt-seconds), and the CGS unit is the maxwell. Magnetic flux is usually measured with a fluxmeter, which contains measuring coils and electronics, that evaluates the change of voltage in the measuring coils to calculate the magnetic flux.The magnetic interaction is described in terms of a vector field, where each point in space (and time) is associated with a vector that determines what force a moving charge would experience at that point (see Lorentz force", "57378c9b1c456719005744aa": "the electrostatic force", "57378e311c456719005744af": "James Clerk Maxwell", "57378e311c456719005744b0": "ferromagnetic materials", "57378e311c456719005744b1": "20", "57378e311c456719005744b2": "four", "57378e311c456719005744b3": "Ampere", "573792ee1c456719005744b9": "electromagnetic theory", "573792ee1c456719005744ba": "photoelectric effect", "573792ee1c456719005744bb": "radio behaved the same as light", "573792ee1c456719005744bc": "Electromagnetic waves", "573792ee1c456719005744bd": "vacuumThe quantum electrodynamic vacuum", "5737958ac3c5551400e51f29": "a woman", "5737958ac3c5551400e51f2a": "the form causes matter to be.\" Thus, it consists of two parts: \"prime matter\" (matter without form), and substantial form", "5737958ac3c5551400e51f2b": "it takes energy", "5737958ac3c5551400e51f2c": "a functioning device and Wolfgang Pauli may not occupy the same room\"", "5737958b1c456719005744c3": "a woman", "5737958b1c456719005744c4": "the form causes matter to be.\" Thus, it consists of two parts: \"prime matter\" (matter without form), and substantial form", "5737958b1c456719005744c5": "it takes energy", "5737958b1c456719005744c6": "a functioning device and Wolfgang Pauli may not occupy the same room\"", "573796edc3c5551400e51f33": "Upon ACT Self-Government", "573796edc3c5551400e51f34": "calorimeters", "573796edc3c5551400e51f35": "becomes repulsive", "573796edc3c5551400e51f36": "via a vector (insect)", "573796edc3c5551400e51f37": "quark\u2013gluon plasma", "57379829c3c5551400e51f3d": "scatter elastically", "57379829c3c5551400e51f3e": "the momentum imparted to the electron by the interaction", "57379829c3c5551400e51f3f": "an unstable atom obtains a more stable ratio of protons to neutrons", "57379829c3c5551400e51f40": "10", "57379829c3c5551400e51f41": "weak nuclear forces and the electromagnetic forces, one into another", "57379a4b1c456719005744cd": "This force may exceed repulsive forces", "57379a4b1c456719005744ce": "spacing between the two atoms becomes smaller, the electron wave functions", "57379a4b1c456719005744cf": "fermions", "57379a4b1c456719005744d0": "Specialized Body-fixed Force", "57379ed81c456719005744d5": "physics)|tension", "57379ed81c456719005744d6": "If you want to save 15% or more on car insurance, you switch to GEICO", "57379ed81c456719005744d7": "Leia's voice", "57379ed81c456719005744d8": "two rounds of seven-card stud betting", "57379ed81c456719005744d9": "Muscle contractions", "5737a0acc3c5551400e51f47": "what path a given system will take following a set of known initial conditions", "5737a0acc3c5551400e51f48": "path a given system will take following a set of known initial conditions", "5737a0acc3c5551400e51f49": "extended fluids", "5737a0acc3c5551400e51f4a": "matter has extended structure and forces", "5737a0acc3c5551400e51f4b": "n't subject to any force whose source is external to the system", "5737a25ac3c5551400e51f51": "High strain composite structureHigh Strain Composite Structures (HSC Structures) are a class of composite material structures designed to perform in a high deformation setting.
